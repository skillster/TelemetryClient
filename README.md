# Telemetry Client

This is a simple example application on how a telemetry client can be written.

## Building

This application requires that the Go compiler is installed on your system.

Start by cloning the repository, and then type `go build` from the command line
in the project directory.

## Usage

Make sure the environment variable SKILLSTER_USE_TELEMETRY is defined. Its value
can be anything, it just needs to be defined.

Then start the application, and after that run the TelemetryClient.exe file.
